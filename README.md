#####  MySql exercise for Epicodus, 8/28/2015

#### By Annie Hoogendoorn

## Description

This app allows a user to list out local shoe stores and the brands of shoes they carry.

##Setup

1. Clone this repository using the command `git clone https://github.com/anniehoogendoorn/ShoeStores.git`.
2. Change directory into the top level of the project folder.
3. Install Composer (https://getcomposer.org) and then run the command `composer install` to download the Silex and Twig vendor files.
4. Change directory into the `web` folder and start your server. For example, using PHPâ€™s built-in server: `php -S localhost:8000`
4. Navigate your browser to the home page at the root address. For example: `http://localhost:8000`.

To recreate the shoes database in MySql follow these steps:
1. At Epicodus, open the bash terminal and run:
`mysql.server start`
followed by the command:
`mysql -uroot -proot`

If you're working with MAMP, once you've started the servers,
you can access your MySQL terminal by entering:
`/Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/mysql --host=localhost -uroot -proot`

2. In the terminal, type:
`> CREATE DATABASE shoes;`
`> USE shoes;`
`> CREATE TABLE stores (id serial PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR (255));`
`> CREATE TABLE brands (id serial PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR (255));`
`> CREATE TABLE stores_brands (id serial PRIMARY KEY, store_id int, brand_id int);`

To recreate the Mysql shoes_test database, follow these steps:
